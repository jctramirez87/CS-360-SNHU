The goal of this mobile app was to create a weight-tracking tool that helps users log daily weight entries, monitor progress over time, and stay motivated with goal-setting and SMS notifications. Designed with simplicity and functionality in mind, the app addresses the core user need of tracking personal health metrics in a way that’s both visual and actionable.

To meet these needs, the app includes several key screens: a login screen for account access, a data grid screen that displays weight entries in a user-friendly layout, and an SMS permission screen that enables users to opt-in for goal alerts. Each screen was designed with usability in mind, using Android Studio’s layout tools to create a clear visual hierarchy and intuitive navigation. The consistent layout and streamlined flow help users quickly understand how to interact with the app, which contributed to a successful user-centered UI.

My coding process involved breaking the project into manageable parts—first designing layouts, then building out Java functionality using SQLite for persistent data storage. I used modular functions and consistent naming conventions to keep the code clean and maintainable. These techniques not only helped me stay organized but also made debugging easier and would be valuable for future mobile development projects.

Testing was an ongoing part of the process. I regularly used the Android Emulator to simulate different user interactions and checked each feature for functionality and UI responsiveness. This helped catch early bugs—like improper input validation or layout issues across screen sizes—and ensured the app worked as expected before final submission. Testing also reinforced the importance of edge cases and user behavior patterns in mobile app development.

One challenge I had to creatively overcome was handling SMS permission gracefully—making sure the app still worked even if the user denied permission. This required conditional logic and thoughtful UI feedback. It pushed me to think more like a real-world developer, anticipating user choices and maintaining app stability regardless.

I’m particularly proud of the way I integrated SQLite database operations into the app. Setting up tables, handling CRUD operations, and ensuring real-time updates to the user interface demonstrated not only technical proficiency but also my ability to bridge back-end logic with a smooth front-end experience. This part of the app shows my growth in full-stack mobile development and my attention to building functional, user-friendly applications from the ground up.
